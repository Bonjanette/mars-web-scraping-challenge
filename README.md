# mars-web-scraping-challenge

Module 11 Challenge Files, CWRU Data Analytics Bootcamp

The folder "Completed_Code" contains the 2 Jupyter Notebooks entitled: "part_1_mars_news" and "part_2_mars_weather" which contain the code for the Challenge. Also contained in the "Complete_Code" folder are "mars_data.json" and "mars_temp_data.csv" which were created in the process of completing this assignment.

Source of code outside of course materials was limited to chatGPT for debugging help and determining a method to alter the grid spacing on the plot used to visually estimate the length of a Martian year in part 2. The rest of the code was derived from course materials.
